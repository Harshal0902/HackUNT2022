# PACT

## 💡 Inspiration

In the era of a pandemic, it is harder than ever to connect with your co-workers. When things are Zoom it's just an excuse to be just less curious. People pay less attention to Zoom than in in-person meetings. And many companies suffer as a result. To tackle this problem we are creating a new way to connect with your co-workers. Our goal of the project is to overcome communication on zoom via interactive media chatroom.

## 💻 What it does

- PACT is a web application where you have to answer few questions based to the meeting hosted few minuets ago
- This will boosting teamwork amongst coworkers
- This will help the employees to get engaing smalltalks between coworkers in virtual meetings
- This will help the employees across the country to get a better understanding of the company culture

## ⚙️ How we built it

- React.Js: For the frontend
- Node.Js and Express.Js: For the backend
- AssemblyAI: For the speech to text
- Hedera: For smart contract
- Tailwind CSS: For the styling

## 💼 RESPEC Challenge

For this year's RESPEC challenge, we built a website that allows users to answer some questions about the meetup which happened a few weeks ago. This year's challenge was to make software or a tool that either: Promotes Accountability, Encourages Caring for others or the environment or Boosts Teamwork amongst members.

## 📚 Research

Research is paramount to gaining a full understanding of the user and their needs. Beyond our own experiences, we needed to dig deeper into the web, outside of our network, and find both organizations that could shed light on how better to help our targeted users as well as to conduct research into other similar applications or products. This was crucial to avoid re-inventing the wheel and wasting valuable time and resources. Here are a few of the resources that were helpful to us:

- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590291120300905

According to this article majority of the students preferred quizzes (75.9%) and assignments (56.3%) at the end of every class for effective learning

## 🔐 Best Blockchain Project Using Hedera - MLH

We are using Hedera’s testnet to make a decentralized **Contract Call and Contract Deploy**. Hedera is a decentralized public network that utilizes the Hashgraph consensus algorithm to overcome the traditional limitations of blockchain and allow one to create the next era of fast, fair, and secure applications.

## 🍻 Dream Big and Create More Cheers with AB InBev - MLH

- We dream to make this app available to all people who have limited access and want to learn new things and make their dream come true to learn.

## 🌐 Best Domain Name from Domain.com - MLH

- Any .tech domain name that is not already taken by Domain.com.

## 🤖 Best Use of AssemblyAI

We are using AssemblyAI's APIs to convert the speech to text. The user can convert his speech to text in the chatroom. We use the /transcript endpoint to make a call to the API using the audio user generates and sends the transcript back to the frontend of the application. We also use the profanity check API to remove curse words from being displayed on our application. Although we implemented the functionality to use AssemblyAI in the backend, we didn't use it in the frontend because we needed an immediate response which was not possible through the API.

Note ⚠️ - The AssemblyAI was taking some time to process the audio and we had to wait for it to finish before we could send the transcript back to the frontend so we had to use react-speech-recognition for that.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- Due to the difference in the time zone it was a bit difficult to collaborate with other developers in the team but we managed to get the project done in time. Complete the project in the given time frame.
- Implementing the speech-to-text feature was a bit tricky but we managed to get it done.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Completing the project in the given time frame.
- Implementing the speech-to-text feature.

## 📖 What we learned

- Collaboration with other developers.
- How to build a full-stack application.
- How to implement Hedera

## 🚀 What's next for PACT

- Making a mobile app.
- Improving the accuracy of the speech-to-text feature.
- Deploying the app to the production server.
