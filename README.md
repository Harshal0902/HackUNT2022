## 💼 RESPEC Challenge

For this year's RESPEC challenge, we built a website that allows users to answer some questions about the meetup which happened few weeks ago. This year's challange was to make a software or a tool that either: Promotes Accountability, Encourages Caring for others or the environment, or Boosts Teamwork amongst members.

## 📚 Research

Research is paramount to gaining a full understanding of the user and their needs. Beyond our own experiences, we needed to dig deeper into the web, outside of our network, and find both organizations that could shed light on how better to help our targeted users as well as to conduct research into other similar applications or products. This was crucial to avoid re-inventing the wheel and wasting valuable time and resources. Here are a few of the resources that were helpful to us:

According to this article majority of the students preferred quiz (75.9%) and assignments (56.3%) at the end of every class for effective learning

## 🤖 Best Use of AssemblyAI

We are using AssemblyAI's APIs to convert the speech to text. The user can convert his speech to text in the chatroom. We use the /transcript endpoint to make a call to the API using the audio user generates and send the transcript back to the frontend of the application. We also use the profanity check API to remove curse words from being displayed on our application. Although we implemented the functionality to use AssemblyAI in the backend, we didn't use it in the frontend because we needed an immediate response which was not possible through the API.

Note ⚠️ — The AssemblyAI was taking some time to process the audio and we had to wait for it to finish before we could send the transcript back to the frontend so we had to use react-speech-recognition for that.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- Due to the difference in the time zone it was a bit difficult to collaborate with other developers in the team but we managed to get the project done in time. Complete the project in the given time frame.
